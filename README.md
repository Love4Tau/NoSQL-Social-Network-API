  ## Description
  In this project, I learned how to use mongoose to create a social network API. After this project, I would choose to use mongoose over SQL, haha! I ran into an issue where my routes were correct but I still could get insomnia to find my server. Shoutout to my teacher, Robbert Wijtman. He helped me figure out the problem - my server.js file did not have the right route in the app.use routes function. I forgot to write it like this: app.use("/api", routes). My api routes did not have an index.js file importing and exporting both routes, so doing this fixed my issue!

  User Story

  AS A social media startup<br>
  I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database<br>
  SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

  Acceptance Criteria

  GIVEN a social network API<br>
  WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application<br>
  THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database<br>
  WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts<br>
  THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON<br>
  WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia<br>
  THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database<br>
  WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia<br>
  THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
